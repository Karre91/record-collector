# record-collector.net

The [Record Collector example and documentation web site](https://record-collector.net) is being filled with content and will have all the informaton on what the project is and does.

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I try to be somewhat compatible with the same content structure and support parsing of TOML, YAML and JSON front matter.

## Bright ideas

The content file layer is converted to C# lists and objects and then used in a regular ASP.NET Core MVC project which is also where you can work _live_ on both content preview and templating. This means you now can use your existing ASP.NET MVC and C# skills creating static site templates!

In this setup the generation process work using the WebApplicationFactory from the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing package so I don't have to fall back to a console application or custom web servers for crunching the files and templates which is the norm for static site generation. Feels a lot better to me and while keeping really fast generation times.

## Installed packages

Built using .NET 5.0 and these packages and projects. Thank you!

### Demo sites

The [demo web site](https://record-collector.net) views are closed source and some parts use [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) which needs a purchased license. I will look into if the full demo site can be opened or made accessible in some form. The demo Website is generated and [deployed with Netlify using their build-image](https://github.com/krompaco/record-collector/blob/main/docs/content-record-collector-net/en/updates/continuous-deployment-using-just-netlify.md).
